      history: "The home of humans.  Approximately 4.5 billion years old, Terra orbits a yellow dwarf star colloquially called 'The Sun.' Humans in their current state have been evolving for millions of years, and now number 26 billion on Terra alone, with another 14 billion system-wide.  The planet is 70% water, with the other portion covered in a variety of terrains, from ice and snow to sandy deserts, from sprawling grasslands to towering mountains. Along with humans, Terra also is home to around 10 billion beings of other species, with 30 billion travelers visiting each year.  Because of the immense population of human and non-human beings on Terra, buildings reach nearly a mile into the sky, and the same distance underground.  Energy is derived almost soley from the sun, as non-renewable resources have been all but used up on the planet.  About 50% of the food is grown on Terra, with the other half is grown on large gardens which orbit the sun. Terra was annexed, along with 3 other planets, in the year 4089 N.E.",

Because of the movement of the molten metals inside, the planet's crust refreshes itself regularly, bringing up metals from the fiery center.  This means there is a massive supply of minerals and metals to mine, but it also makes the surface, and living on the planet, unstable and many times deadly.  Most of the beings on the planet work for one of the mining companies that lay claim to the planet.  While most slave away on, and below, the planet's surface, bringing up materials from the depths, the fat cat mining executives float above the atmosphere in lavish space-cities which orbit the fiery planet.",

      history: "During the Great Scare, many of the richest people and families looked to flee to somewhere safer.  Those that could afford it left in massive technologically advanced ships created by the Osassin company.  These ships were said to be the fastest and able to support people for the longest time, with a brand new relatively untested star drive. These ships coordinated at first, but soon factions developed, captains and crew had different ideas about where to go in the galaxy to find save haven, and the ships split into different directions.  There was unfortunately an almost always fatal error of the star drives of these ships.  All ships were lost at some point, except for one.  This one found the planet of Ark.  It was thus named because they felt they'd survived a great flood of their own.  Over many years, these people were unable to continue working the technology from their ships, and so they began to revert to simpler means of living.  After many more years, the generations began to hold their identity in being a simpler people.  The planet became a haven for people who wanted the simpler life, free of many of the stresses and fears that come from the most modern technologies",

      description: "Completely covered by water, the only land is man made and sparse across the planet.  The planets native inhabitants occupy immense underwater cities, while non-natives inhabit the above-water cities.",
      history: "Aquarus was formed approximately 3.5 billion years ago.  Along with innumerable other species that live below the waves, one particularly intelligent and adept species, called hydrams, evolved and made the planet their own.  The hydrams have had massive sweeping cities below the oceans for thousands of years (possibly millions, depending on if you belive Hydra folklore). Aquarus was initally thought to be devoid of intelligent life, as most of the inital observations were spacecraft simply surveying the surface of the water, which meant they missed the complexity of life that dwelled just out of sight. When humans first discovered Aquarus and learned of it's inhabitants, they attempted to bring Aquarus into the federation, first by diplomatic means, and then by war.  While the humans technology outmatched that of the hydrams, they simply could not retain a foothold on the water planet.  The hydrams have evolved to fit the planet perfectly, and simply could not be ousted from their native land.  After centuries of conflict, Aquarus become some what of a territory, part of the federation but still it's own territory, with it's own laws, governing body, customs, and religions. Currently, Aquarus is dotted by numerous hubs of man-made land and structures.  Though Aquarian technology was almost on par with that of humans, they did not have one major thing that humans had: space travel.  When humans came along, they introduced the technology to leave the planet, though much work went into building the physical structures on the planet, since space travel needed land to work from.  Much of the water is dominated by hydrams, though many humans and other species live among them using special suits to breathe and communicate and work underwater.  Many non-hydrams visit underwater cities for short periods of time, but some have commited to living their entire lives under the surface, depending on technology to keep them alive.  Above the water, man-made islands create small hubs for land dwellers.  Much of the above water activity has to do with trade, space travel, military, and federation activity.  As well, it is the best place to use their sun as energy.",
